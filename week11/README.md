# Week 11: Midterm Exam 2

**Exam Schedule:** Tuesday & Thursday (電腦教室考試)

---

## Exam Coverage

### All Previous Material (Weeks 1-7)
Review Week 8 for Phase 1 & 2 coverage.

### Phase 3: Algorithms & Logic (Weeks 9-10)
- Functional programming (`map`, `filter`)
- Lambda functions
- Sorting with custom keys
- List comprehensions
- Permutations and brute force
- Graph theory basics
- Distance matrices
- Route optimization

---

## What to Review

1. **Lambda Functions** — Write concise anonymous functions
2. **Sorting** — Sort complex data with custom key functions
3. **Filtering** — Use `filter()` and list comprehensions
4. **Permutations** — Generate and iterate through orderings
5. **Route Optimization** — Find shortest paths through brute force

## Sample Practice Problems

### Problem 1: Sorting
Given a list of places with ratings and distances, sort by rating (descending), then by distance (ascending) for ties.

### Problem 2: Filtering
Filter a list of restaurants to only include those with:
- Rating >= 4.0
- Walking time <= 10 minutes
- Category == "pizza"

### Problem 3: Optimization
Given a 4x4 distance matrix, find the shortest route visiting all locations.

### Problem 4: Combined
Write a function that takes a list of places and returns the top 3 highest-rated places within 15 minutes walking distance, in optimal visiting order.
